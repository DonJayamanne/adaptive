# Tutorial Adaptive

[Adaptive](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive)
is a package for adaptively sampling functions with support for parallel
evaluation.

This is an introductory notebook that shows some basic use cases.

We recommend to start with the {ref}`Tutorial `~adaptive.Learner1D``.

Because this documentation consists of static html, the `live_plot` and `live_info` widget is not live.
